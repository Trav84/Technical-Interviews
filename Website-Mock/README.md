The Exercise

I've attached two high-resolution images (one with a tooltip shown and one with it hidden) of a single page to build. It's totally contrived for the sake of this little project. What I care to see at the end is the source code of the styles you authored, the HTML you wrote, and the code to handle the tooltip. 

For me, that was simply a little directory of Sass, CSS, JavaScript, and an index.html. (I just created a local folder to serve things out of and developed at http://localhost:8000.)

Some notes and instructions:

* Feel free to use any CSS preprocessor you prefer, but not a framework please.
* For the tooltip, please write this code without a plugin. You're welcomed to use jQuery, but this was under 50 lines of (not overly succinct) code, and I'd prefer to see some code from scratch rather than using a tooltip plugin.
* Vanilla JS is preferred, but I've got no problem with transpiling ES6 if you're in the mood. Just not CoffeeScript or TypeScript or anyotherscript please.

Yaks you probably shouldn't shave as part of this:

* Any cross-browser compatibility. Just tell me which browser you developed in.
* Handling tooltip awareness of browser edges or content size or anything where you'd have to dynamically reposition it.
* Absolute and total pixel-precision. Do what you feel comfortable with here, but if you think an interaction would be better or look nicer, feel free to deviate and explain why.
* Making it work offline. You should link to the remote jQuery and Open Sans instead of directly including them.

If you come out of the exercise without being able to point to anything and say "it'd be better if I took the time to [x]", then you probably spent too much time on it :)

I completed this, and it took me around 3 hours. You might be faster or slower, but if you find yourself getting frustrated or spending too much time, feel free to skip something, note that you did, and we can circle up on it afterward. I'll share my code then, too, and we can both learn from one another.
