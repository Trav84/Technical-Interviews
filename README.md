# Technical-Interviews

The idea behind this repo is to store the various coding challenges, Whiteboarding questions, and technical interview questions/issues we have been given to serve as a helpful guide for both current and future Iron Yard graduates in understanding what they may face during the hiring process in their quest for a job.
