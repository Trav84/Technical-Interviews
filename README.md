# Technical-Interviews

The idea behind this repo is to store the various coding challenges, Whiteboarding questions, and technical interview questions/issues we have been given. This will serve as a helpful guide for both current and future Iron Yard graduates in understanding what they may face during the hiring process in their quest for a job.

##Questions asked by young startups in their Series A round
###Would your webapp scale for 10,000 users, and how?
Talk about the backend. If you're using a BaaS like Firebase, you might explain how it is great for prototyping quickly but to stay flexible you would build a custom backend. Building your own backend would also keep costs down since BaaS' can get expensive when scaling.

###How are devops important to a startup and give an example of you doing devops?
