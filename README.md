# Technical-Interviews

The idea behind this repo is to store the various coding challenges, Whiteboarding questions, and technical interview questions/issues we have been given. This will serve as a helpful guide for both current and future Iron Yard graduates in understanding what they may face during the hiring process in their quest for a job.

Just throw me a pull request to add a new problem/question/etc. Please just put it in a folder with a description of the problem. We can try to keep all questions in their own directory (Interview Questions) Also, remove or don't make any reference to the company that gave it. 

Thanks!
